# PandaCommandWhitelist

## Description

A simple mod for configuring what commands can be whitelisted for use and suggestion. Supports basic "*" wildcards. 

## Configuring

config/PandaCommandWhitelist.json generated at runtime

```
[
  "tell *",
  "me *",
  "msg *",
  "w *",
  "ignore *",
  "unignore *",
  "ignorelist",
  "discord"
]
```

You can either put the specific command, or the initial world and a wildcard to allow any command.
